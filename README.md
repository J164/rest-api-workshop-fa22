 ## TO DO
 
 1. Use [this website](https://freebie.opensourceatillinois.com/) to check the functionality of your API
 2. Write the 5 HTTP methods in `api/app.py`
    * get(“/”) - returns a key-value pair, with key "message" and value "Welcome to OSAI"
            *TIP: Refer to slide 14  
    * get(“/events”) - returns events currently stored in the API
    * post(“/events”) - Adds an event to the end of the events dictionary stored in the API
            * `request.json` contains the data you add in the form
            * puts the data into a new key-value pair in events
            * returns the index in string format  
    * patch(“/events/<event_id>”)
            * Updates the event for the given id
    * delete(“/events/<event_id>”)
            * takes in 1 argument called event_id of int type
            * deletes the key-value pair with the id passed in
            * returns a "Deletion Successful" message
